planning_guidelines: |-
  - If findings are partially sufficient, create a plan to find ONLY the MISSING information.
  - Keep steps granular and actionable.
  - Each step should be achievable with one or two tool calls.
  - If you have enough information, return a single step: ["Synthesize the final answer"]

  Example: ["Search for class SearchTool", "Read the file containing SearchTool", "Find usages of the search method"]
