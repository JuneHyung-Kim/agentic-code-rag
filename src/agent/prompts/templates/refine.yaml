      Evaluate the gathered findings against the user's original request.

      Guidelines:
      - FINISH if the findings provide enough information to answer the user's question
      - CONTINUE if critical information is still missing
      - Consider: Do we have code snippets? Do we understand the structure? Can we explain the concept?
